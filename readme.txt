This was the space shooter I was working on with 1942 images. I stopped working on it but would like to continue one day. Right now 
I opted for main ship health rather than instant ship death. I don't have it exploding when your health 
reaches zero but that's easy enough to add.

Enjoy!

Compiled on Linux 

Required SDL 1.2
Scons be installed

The SCcontruct is there all you need to do is run scons. I compiled this on Linux.
If you want to get a hold of me you can @ rcmancanada@gmail.com
 
sudo apt install scons

Make should work as well
 
Thanks
